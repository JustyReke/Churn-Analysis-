# INTRODUCTION
Customer churn is a significant concern in the financial sector, as it not only reduces revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new customers. Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition and identifying patterns related to churn are crucial for developing effective retention strategies.

This study analyzes customer churn data from a financial institution to uncover key insights. It examines various demographic and financial factors, including credit score, location, age, tenure, account balance, and estimated salary, to determine their impact on customer retention.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The financial services industry operates within a dynamic and multidimensional ecosystem, where various factors influence consumer behavior.

A Canadian bank, struggling with customer retention, sought assistance from Datafied Technologies. The bank was experiencing significant customer churn, which negatively impacted both customer satisfaction and revenue. Additionally, the bank lacked insights into the key factors driving customer decisions to leave or remain.

To address this issue proactively, the bank provided a churn database containing information on 10,000 customers over a six-month period. This data serves as a foundation for identifying and mitigating the factors contributing to customer attrition.
