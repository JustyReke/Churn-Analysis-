# INTRODUCTION
Customer churn is a significant concern in the financial sector, as it not only reduces revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new customers. Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition and identifying patterns related to churn are crucial for developing effective retention strategies.

This study analyzes customer churn data from a financial institution to uncover key insights. It examines various demographic and financial factors, including credit score, location, age, tenure, account balance, and estimated salary, to determine their impact on customer retention.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The financial services industry operates within a dynamic and multidimensional ecosystem, where various factors influence consumer behavior.

A Canadian bank, struggling with customer retention, sought assistance from Datafied Technologies. The bank was experiencing significant customer churn, which negatively impacted both customer satisfaction and revenue. Additionally, the bank lacked insights into the key factors driving customer decisions to leave or remain.

To address this issue proactively, the bank provided a churn database containing information on 10,000 customers over a six-month period. This data serves as a foundation for identifying and mitigating the factors contributing to customer attrition.

# DATA TRANSFORMATION 
The dataset underwent a comprehensive cleaning and transformation process to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and addressing inconsistencies in the data. Additionally, new conditional columns were introduced, derived from existing attributes, to provide deeper insights and improve the dataset's analytical value. These enhancements helped refine the structure of the data, making it more suitable for further analysis and modeling.

This Churn Customer Analysis Dashboard provides a detailed visualization of customer churn trends for a financial institution. Below is a structured interpretation and key insights from the dashboard:

# DATA INSIGHT
 - Overall Customer Churn Status
Total Customers: 10,000
Churned Customers: 2,000 (20%)
Retained Customers: 8,000 (80%)
The churn rate of 20% indicates that a significant portion of customers is leaving the bank. This highlights a need for targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty.

- Customer Demographics
Gender Distribution:
Male Customers: 5,457 (55%)
Female Customers: 4,543 (45%)
The customer base is relatively balanced in terms of gender, with males forming a slight majority. Understanding gender-based behavioral differences could help refine retention strategies.

- Churned Customers by Geography
France: 5,010 customers (50.14%)
Germany: 2,510 customers (25.09%)
Spain: 2,480 customers (24.77%)
The highest number of customers (50%) belong to France, followed by Germany (25%) and Spain (24%). If churn rates vary significantly by country, targeted interventions may be needed in regions with higher attrition.

- Churned Customers by Tenure
The highest number of churned customers had the following tenure lengths:

1 Year: 232
3 Years: 213
9 Years: 213
5 Years: 209
Customers tend to leave within the first few years (1-3 years) and also around 9 years. This suggests that both early engagement strategies and long-term customer relationship management are crucial for retention.

- Credit Score Analysis
Most customers have a Good or Fair credit score.
Fewer customers have Excellent, Poor, or Very Poor credit scores.
Customers with good and fair credit scores form the largest portion of the customer base. It is essential to analyze whether credit score impacts churn behavior, especially among customers with poor scores, as they might be struggling financially.

- Churned Customers by Age Group
Adults (30-45 years) have the highest churn rate.
Young Adults (18-29 years) also experience moderate churn.
Senior Adults (45+ years) and Young (under 18 years) show significantly lower churn.
The adult age group (30-45 years) is the most vulnerable to churn, possibly due to career changes, financial commitments, or better offers from competitors. Understanding their needs and providing tailored financial solutions could improve retention.

# CONCLUSION
Churn Rate Concern: A 20% churn rate is significant, requiring immediate attention.
Geographical Focus: France has the highest number of customers; churn patterns should be analyzed by region.
Tenure-Based Churn: Early-stage and long-term customers require different retention strategies.
Credit Score Considerations: Customers with lower credit scores might need financial support programs to reduce churn.
Age-Specific Strategies: Adults (30-45 years) are the most likely to churn, suggesting a need for engagement efforts tailored to this group.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

 Implement customer engagement programs to retain early-stage customers.

- Offer loyalty incentives for long-tenure customers to prevent them from leaving.

- Focus on regional strategies, especially in France, to understand churn patterns.

- Provide financial advisory services to customers with lower credit scores.

- Develop age-specific retention plans, particularly for the adult segment.

By addressing these factors, the bank can reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.
